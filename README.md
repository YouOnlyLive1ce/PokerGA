# Poker Genetic Algorithm Project

## Overview
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to evolve strategies for playing poker. The GA evolves a population of poker-playing agents through successive generations, with the aim of optimizing their performance in the game.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Utilizes a genetic algorithm to evolve strategies for playing poker.
- **Population**: Maintains a population of poker-playing agents, with each agent representing a potential strategy.
- **Selection**: Employs selection mechanisms such as tournament selection or roulette wheel selection to choose individuals for reproduction.
- **Crossover**: Implements crossover techniques to combine genetic material from selected individuals to create offspring.
- **Mutation**: Incorporates mutation operations to introduce variation into the population and prevent premature convergence.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Evaluates the fitness of each individual based on their performance in simulated poker games.
- **Termination Criteria**: Defines criteria for terminating the evolution process, such as reaching a maximum number of generations.
